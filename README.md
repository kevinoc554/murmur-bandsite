## Features
### Header
- Each page features a header, consisting of a brand logo (which doubles as a link to the homepage) and a navbar which provides links to the site's other pages and to an external merch store.
- This header is responsive, and on smaller screen sizes collapes into a list that is toggled with a button. 

### Footer
- Each page features a footer, consisting of copyright information in the bottom left, and links to the relevant social media sites in the right.
- This header is responsive, and on smaller screen sizes shifts to a centered alignement with the copyright information on top, and the social links below.

### Hero Image
- Each page features a hero image, featuring an image of a live music performance and a jumbotron prominently displaying the band name.
- This image is intened to invoke the energy and spectacle of live music, and utilizes a color palatte that is consistent with the rest of the site.

### Home 
- The home page consists of a series of news paragraphs from the band, providing updates to interested parties (fans or promoters) on topics like new releases and upcoming tour dates.
- Each news item is accompanied by an image depicting a live music event, featuring light shows or pyrotechnics. Again, these images are intended to elict a positive response from the user by invoking the atmosphere of a gig or festival.
- On smaller screen sizes, these news items and images display as a list instead, seperated by styled horizontal rules.

- This button triggers a modal that displays over the whole page, and consists of a form that asks users to provided their name and email address in order to subscribe to the mailing list.

### Discography
- The discography page consists of the album artwork of all the band’s previous releases displayed with the alum title and release year in chronological order.
- On desktop/laptop screens, the album info will be concealed initially and revealed on mouse over, giving a sense of interactivity to the user's experience.

### Contact
- The contact page consists of a form that allows any prospective booking agents or promoters to reach out to the band regarding potential shows.
- The form asks the user to provide a name, email address, a location (city/venue), and a proposed date. The form also contains a textarea which allows the user to freehand some text explaining their proposal.
